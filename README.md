# roam-hug-theme
This is the Roam Hugs Theme! Easy install either with Roam Toolkit or Stylus, by copy and pasting [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kipply/roam-hug-theme/master/theme.css). 

This is a background-greyscale but also colourful dark theme, which I felt the need to make because I don't like blue-ish backgrounds, I like colourful text and most other dark themes don't cover all the elements.

Hug Theme covers diagrams, aliases, kanban boards, date picker, the "All Pages" page, search, and even the astrolabe! 

Please open an issue with any requests / bugs! <3
