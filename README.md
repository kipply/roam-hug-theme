# roam-hug-theme
This is the Roam Hugs Theme! Easy install either with Roam Toolkit or Stylus, by copy and pasting [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kipply/roam-hug-theme/master/theme.css). Check it out with [this Roam page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/kipply/page/EE-wV1Z1V?help) which contains all the Roam elements I know of!

This is a background-greyscale but also colourful dark theme, which I felt the need to make because I don't like blue-ish backgrounds, I like colourful text and most other dark themes don't cover all the elements.

Hugs Theme covers diagrams, aliases, kanban boards, date picker, the "All Pages" page, search, and even the astrolabe! 

Please open an issue with any requests / bugs! <3
